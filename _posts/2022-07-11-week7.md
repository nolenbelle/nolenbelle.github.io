This notebook was developed in a paired programming setting. A few highlights this week included the growing familiarity with how to navigate these tools. Through a few of the things that Sommer and I hashed out were later deemed not the entirely correct direction in terms of library usage, it felt good to be able to overcome more and more bugs and to be able to crunch through notebooks a bit quicker.
